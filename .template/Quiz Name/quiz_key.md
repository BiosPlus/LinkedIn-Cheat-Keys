Due to the way that linkedin randomly selects both questions and answers from it's pool, quiz keys should follow these layout rules:

- Questions should not have a preceeding number (ie, Q1, Q2, etc)
- Questions should be listed alphabetically.
- Answers to the corresponding question should be listed alphabetically.

Formatting:

- Questions/Answers should always use the markdown layout/format:

```
#### *Question?*
    - [ ] Answer A
    - [ ] Answer B
    - [X] Answer C
    - [ ] Answer D
```

Which essentially produces this format:

#### *Which database is a NoSQL database type that can quickly store and retrieve key-value pairs?*
- [ ] Aurora
- [X] DynamoDB
- [ ] Neptune
- [ ] ORDS for MySQL
